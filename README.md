We are asked to calculate the motion of a nonlinear pendulum via two methods. 

The first method asks to solve the two first-order equations using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for a pendulum with an 8 cm arm and released from a standstill at θ = −179 deg from the vertical. We are then asked to make a graph of θ as a function of time; this graph is given in the repository and is titled 'Pendulum_RK.eps'. 

The second method asks to solve the two first-order equations using the Leapfrog method for a pendulum with an 8 cm arm and released from a standstill at θ = 89 deg from the vertical. We are then asked to make a graph of θ as a function of time; this graph is given in the repository and is titled 'Pendulum_LF.eps'.  #Need to upload this part. 

The third part asks us to extend the programs to create an animation of the motion of the pendulum and should, at a minimum, include a representation of the moving pendulum bob and the pendulum arm. I could not get this part to work for me.
